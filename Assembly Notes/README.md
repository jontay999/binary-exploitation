- Notes taken from pwn.college youtube channel
- I am not intelligent enough to come up with all these myself

- For accessing registers partially we can use this
  ![assembly](./assembly.png)

- Due to historical oddity, accessing `eax` will zero out the rest of `rax`, other partial accesses will not

- list of registers
  ![register](./register-list.png)

- to do syscalls, set `rax` to the proper syscall number
